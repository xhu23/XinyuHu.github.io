title: Compare R and SAS
---

SAS was the first statistical language I learned. Now as I am taking ST558, R becomes one of the focus. Here I want to compare SAS and R with some details.

*What are your thoughts on R vs SAS?* 
I think they are very much different. While SAS is more for statistician, R is more for data scientist.SAS has many built-in procedures that we can directly use to manipulate and analyze data. It's more new comer friendly as it requires less coding experience, especially when it comes to simple statistical modeling. It's standard and well-defined, which makes statistician works easier. R is more like a formal programing language. You will be able to alter data line by line, cell by cell with very flexible data structures it supports. So it supports the dynamic nature of data scientist work very well.


*What functionality do you like about R? *
Open source nature. Yes, it means less support, but it opens a whole new world of possibilities. The freedom of creating packages and using them provided us so many ways of cleaning, changing, and modeling data.

What parts do you miss about your other language?  
Standard introduction of procedures. SAS provides a very detailed guidebook online. So if I have any question about a procedure, I can just search online and obtain official guidebook on the paramemters. It's super detailed and easy to navigate. However, for R, I have to check multiple results from google, stackoverflow to get an idea about what's going wrong. 

Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? 
It's a little hard to begin. But as I have been exposed to R during ST501 and ST502, it didn't surprise me when ST 558 begin. I am excited to learn more about R!
