title: Reflection on Project 1
---

Project 1 was very interesting experience for me. I felt difficult to figure out the process line in the very beginning, an dgradually have a better picture while doing it step by step. Though I am still facing problem like, could not set up the github page, the plots all disappeared in the README.md file, I have learnt a lot along the way.  

My project 1 link is [here](https://xhu23.github.io/project1)  

*Finding Outlines*  
**Timing of Franchise Creation**: Historically, there are 2 big peak time that franchises were created, one before 1950, and one after. Also, it would be helpful to cetegorize franchises by their tenure.  
**Active Player vs Non Active Player**: There are more non-active skaters and goalies than active ones. Looking at them side by side provides some interesting points.  
**Winner take all** Skaters that have most goal one season are very likly have higher most assist one season, and most of them also in the list of being high in most point one game.  
**More points in the md file**: There are more finding points here and there in the output file.  

*What should you do differently?*  
I think I should start earlier, and also read more discussion than googling when I have question. Even though some questions asked in the discussion seems not intuitive to me, I can save so much time by avoiding unnecessary search.

*What was the most difficult part for you?*  
I cannot find the tab to **enable github page**. I spent 3 hours focusing on the Setting tabs on the left, and never checked the rolling bar on the brower. After asking for help in the discussion,  Yu Jiang told me I can actually roll down the setting page. What a lesson! Also, when push markdown file directly from Rstudio, **plots are gone**.  

*What are the big take-away from this project?*  
Experience matters. Having more exposure to the project like this will better equip me for the job market.
