title: Reflection on progress so far
---

So far, I think I am following well.  
The most difficult period was the time when I was firstly exposed to Gitbub. Since my background wasn't so technical before I started the program, the Git looked quite hard to me.  While I'm still having hard time when it comes to Git, I think I am gradually obtain confidence in it.  
The happy moment came when I refect how much I have learned from this course. Especially, those packages are all very helpful, and tailored for special need. I have get used to goolging online to find the best package to my need.  
Summer 10 week is a little intense for me, but I have tried my best!
