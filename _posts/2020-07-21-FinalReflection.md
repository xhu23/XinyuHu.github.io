title: Final Reflection On The Course
---

**what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?**  

My original answer was: Being a data scientist needs to know how to let data tell its story, by applying software to analysis data based on statistic knowledge.To be a capable data scientist or statistician nowadays, we need to be proficient on stat software as well as statistic background knowledge. Data scientist might be focus on applied statistics.  
I think my understanding of data scientist role doesn't change, but got clearer and detailed with this course. I learned lots of coding, sharing, docking, and project managing techniques from this courses, which is super beneficial for my future job.  Also, ggplot is a super helpful way of visualization data than I used to think. It will be a daily-using pacakge for me. While I thought data scientist was more on analyzing data, this course taught me that big portion of the work will be on visualization of data and crafting tools to share results.  

**what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**  

Totally. I will continue use R, and will explore more packages as I get into the data science world! R is super handy programming tool with dynamic features and multiple output extension. RMarkdown and Shiny are both great!  

**what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**  
1) Make chart beautiful! I used to create ugly plot/charts for homework. Now with ggplot, I will make my charts beautiful.  
2) RMarkdown and Shiny. WIll use this as way for future homework delivery.  
3) Get rid of fearing to learn new packages. I am excited to learn new packages and their associated syntax!
