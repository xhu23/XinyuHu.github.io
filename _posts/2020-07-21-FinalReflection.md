title: Final Reflection On The Course
---

what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do? 
My original answer was: Being a data scientist needs to know how to let data tell its story, by applying software to analysis data based on statistic knowledge.To be a capable data scientist or statistician nowadays, we need to be proficient on stat software as well as statistic background knowledge. Data scientist might be focus on applied statistics. 

I think my understanding of data scientist role doesn't change, but got clearer and detailed with this course. I learned lots of coding, sharing, docking, and project managing techniques from this courses, which is super beneficial for my future job.  

what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
